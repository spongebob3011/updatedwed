         <h3>The history of video games goes as far back as the early 1950s. when academic computer scientists began designing simple games and simulations as part of their research or just for fun.
         At M.I.T. in the 1960s, professors and students played games like 3D tic-tac-toe and Moon Landing. These games were played on computer such as the IBM 1560. Video games did not reach mainstream popularity until the 1970s and 1980s,
         when video arcade games and gaming conso les using joysticks, buttons, and other controllers, along with graphics on computer screens and home computer games were introduced to the general public.</h3>
